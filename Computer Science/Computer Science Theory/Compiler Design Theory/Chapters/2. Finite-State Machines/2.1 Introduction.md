### 2.1 Introduction

The basis of compiler theory is build on the mathematical model of automata theory. Thus we start our journey into the wild land of compilation with learning the simplest unit within automata theory; the ***finite-state machine***.

They are directly useful for compiler design because:
- Finite-state machines have the capacity of performing( at least to a first approximation) a number of the easier compiling tasks. in particular, the design of the lexical box can almost always be based on a finite-state machine
- Since the simulation of a finite-state machine by a computer requires only a small number of operations to process an individual input symbol, it operates rapidly
- The simulation of a finite-state machine requires a fixed amount of memory storage which simplifies memory-management problems
- A number of theorems and algorithms exist which enable one to construct and simplify finite-state machines for various purposes

Basically, **finite-state machines are *directly compatible for this problem, fast, memory efficient, and extensively researched within this scope* **.

There are many definitions of the finite-state machine within automata literature, but the commonalities between them are such that a finite-state machine is that they are a computational model with a **finite amount of memory** and **read sequences made up of a finite amount of input symbols**. 

The differences between the finite-state machines within the aforementioned literature, is within the content and designation of their "outputs". The finite-state machines, abbreviated FSM from now on, that we will be dealing with to start will have an "output" that tells us the "acceptance" of the inputted sequence, that is, whether the sequence is **"well formed" or "syntactically correct"**. For example, a sequence that is supposed to denote a number constant will not be "well formed" if it contains two decimal points.
