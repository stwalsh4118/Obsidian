### Finite-State Recognizers

A finite-state recognizer is a model of a FSM that checks whether an input is "acceptable" or "well formed" like we stated earlier

For example a FSM that checks whether a sequence of 1's and 0's has odd parity, meaning the number of 1's is odd, would be a finite-state recognizer. We will design one of these "parity checkers" in an attempt to familiarize ourselves with the basics of FSMs
