### 1.6 The MINI-BASIC Compiler

Within the course of this book we will carry out the design of the [[MINI-BASIC]] compiler. It will bring up many of the actual functionalities and problems represented in the general compiler case. It will be a one-pass compiler based off of the [[1.2 A Naive Compiler Model|Naive Compiler Model]] and consist of a [[1.2 A Naive Compiler Model#span class green Lexical Box span|lexical box]], [[1.2 A Naive Compiler Model#span class orange Syntax Box span|syntax box]], and a [[1.2 A Naive Compiler Model#span class brown Code Generator span|code generator]]. Each box is assumed to be a *completely separate* entity. 

The process in which the compiler will carry out is as follows:

The lexical box will process a symbol from its input then either process another input or tell the syntax box to wake up. When the syntax box wakes up it will produce an output from its input and then either produce more outputs (by either already having inputs or asking the lexical box for more inputs) or tell the code generator to wake up. The code generator will then produce the final output from the input then either produce more output or ask the syntax box for more input, etc, etc, until the entire source program has been translated to machine code.
