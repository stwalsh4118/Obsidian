### 1.3 Passes And Boxes
 
 The control flow between the boxes can be set up in multiple ways, four of those being: single-pass and three-pass, and two two-pass.
 
 - Single-pass:  Control is passed between the boxes when needed, one at a time symbols are recognized then generated into atoms then code.
 - Triple-pass: All symbols are generated from the source program then all atoms are generated then all code is generated
 - Double-pass: There could be a single-pass like interface between either the lexical box and syntax box or the syntax box and the code generator.

In general this pass concept is useful for a variety of reasons:


#### Logic of the language
Some part of the code may imply that it needs multiple passes within the compiler, for example if the code references an identifier before it is declared. This case would require at least 2 passes to generate the identifier declaration for it to be actually used. 


#### Code optimization

Code can be better optimized if it has the max amount of context about the program it is compiling, for example knowing where every declaration is and where values can be changed. This takes at least one pass for the optimization to be able to know this context. 

#### Memory considerations

Memory can be saved with multi-pass compilers since the memory from the previous pass can be used again in later passes.
