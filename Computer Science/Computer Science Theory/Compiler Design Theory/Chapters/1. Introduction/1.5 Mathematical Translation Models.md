### 1.5 Mathematical Translation Models
The compiler itsself is a translator but it itsself is not the thing doing the translation. The compiler is an interconnection of basic building block automata, that carry out the actual operations of the translation.

The design theory consists of two parts:

1. The mathematical study of these machines including:
	1. Their capabilities as language translators
	2. Their synthesis, given the translations they are to perform
2. The application of this theory to compiler design including:
	1. Expressing the design of the compiler (or a box of a compiler) as an interconnection of these machine models
	2. Implementing or simulating these models as a computer program
