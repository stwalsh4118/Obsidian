### 1.1 Language Processors
There is a gap in the ability for humans to communicate with machines in general. We try to remedy this by creating artificial languages that we humans can understand and write and that can be turned into a language that a machine can understand, that being a stream of bits that instructs the machine on what operations to do.

This task, the creation of this stream of bits from our human artificial language, is completed with the help of a <span class="purple">***language processor***</span>, meant to bridge the proverbial gap in language between man and machine.

There are two different types of said language processors, generally speaking;

#### <span class="red">**Interpreters**</span> and <span class="blue">**Translators**</span>

<span class="red">Interpreters</span> accept an input program from a *source language* and subsequently perform the operations within the program directly.

<span class="blue">Translators</span>, of which there are two, compilers and assemblers, take the input program from the * source language* and transform them into the *object language*, generally the machine language for the given machine the translator is running on. Compilers translate high-level code and assemblers translate low-level code.

Common foundation of all compilers is based within Automata Theory.
